# C Journey 🧠⚙️

This repository documents my personal journey learning the **C programming language from scratch**.

I am studying C independently, following structured resources and reinforcing concepts through small, focused programs and hands-on exercises.

The goal of this repository is **not perfection**, but **consistent progress and understanding**.
